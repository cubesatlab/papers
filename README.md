LaTeX Resources
---------------

This repository also contains various resources related to the use of LaTeX in the CubeSat
Laboratory documents. Specifically, global bibliographic databases used by the BibTeX tool,
LaTeX style information, formatting rules used by various journals, slide templates, and other
resources are all here.

For a quick primer on LaTeX see the [LaTeX at VTC](http://www.pchapin.org/VTC/LaTeX/LaTeX.zip)
document. The [Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf)
is also an excellent resource.

We recommend using [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) for managing BibTeX databases. Note
that a text editor is technically all that is necessary but JabRef provides many useful services
most text editors do not.
