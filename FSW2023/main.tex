\begin{abstract}
  % Summarize the contents of the paper using no more than 400 words (what is the FSW limit?)

  This is the awesome abstract. Read it and weep at its beauty.

  % My thought for this paper would be to compare CubedOS Message Service (CMS?) with the
  % message passing facility in CFS. The Flight Software Workshop audience will be interested in
  % this comparison.
  %
  % I also wonder if this work/paper can be combined with the CFS bridge idea that I've been
  % wanting to pursue. Or perhaps two papers could be written. Just some ideas.
