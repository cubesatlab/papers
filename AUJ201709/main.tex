\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we present CubedOS, a lightweight application framework for CubeSat flight
  software. CubedOS is written in \SPARK and proved free of certain classes of runtime errors.
  It consists of a collection of interacting, concurrent modules that communicate via message
  passing over a microkernel based on Ada's Ravenscar tasking model. It provides core services
  such as, for example, communication protocol processing and publish/subscribe message
  handling. Application-specific modules can be added to provide both high level functions such
  as navigation and power management, as well as low level device drivers for mission-specific
  hardware.

  Keywords: SPARK, student project, CubeSat
