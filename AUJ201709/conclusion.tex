\section{Conclusion}

CubedOS is an application framework based on message passing that is intended to support the
flight software of space missions, particularly CubeSat missions. Our early experience with
CubedOS is favorable. The architecture seems to provide an effective way to organize
flight software.

Unlike similar projects such as cFE and Kubos, CubedOS is written entirely in \SPARK\ and proved
free of runtime errors in the sense meant by \SPARK. It is necessary to manully suppress certain
\SPARK\ messages related to information flow through the CubedOS mailbox array. However, we feel
the danger of doing this is minimal since the easy to understand architecture of the system
ensures no flow problems will actually arise in practice.

CubedOS provides a great deal of concurrency and runtime flexibility, but sacrifices some static
type safety to achieve this. We mitigate the danger using a tool, XDR2OS3, that generates
message encoding and decoding subprograms based on strongly typed message descriptions. The
output of the tool is verified by \SPARK.

We intend to release CubedOS to the open source CubeSat community once we have completed an ITAR
review of our code base  and possibly release both  ITAR compliant and U.S non ITAR compliant versions.
 We anticipate that release to be some time in mid-2018.
